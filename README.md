WorthTheHype

WorthTheHype is a credibility-first, city-based restaurant discovery platform built for Kerala.

Instead of showing what’s popular, it compares online hype with real user experience and surfaces the gap — called the Delta.

🔍 How It Works

Hype Score – online buzz

Reality Score – first-hand community reviews

Delta – difference between perception and reality

Positive delta → worth visiting
Negative delta → likely overhyped

🧠 AI (No-BS)

Evaluates review text for specificity and tone

Tags reviews as Likely Genuine or Low Confidence

Generates a neutral community summary per restaurant

AI never removes reviews — it only affects influence
