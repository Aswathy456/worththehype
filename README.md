Project Description
WorthTheHype is a city-based restaurant discovery platform that compares online hype with real user experiences. It helps users identify whether a restaurant is genuinely worth visiting or simply overhyped.
________________________________________
The Problem Statement
Food discovery platforms often prioritize popularity and promotions, leading users to visit overhyped restaurants with poor real-world experiences. Fake reviews, bots, and promotional content further reduce trust in existing systems.
________________________________________
The Solution
WorthTheHype introduces a credibility-first approach by separating hype from reality. It uses community-driven reviews, visible account credibility, and AI-assisted review analysis to surface honest dining experiences instead of promotional noise.
